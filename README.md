# Fraud Trends in Canada (2021â€“2025)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes public fraud complaint data from the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) covering the years 2021 to March 2025. Using Python and SQL logic, the project identifies major fraud types, regional trends, financial loss patterns, and victim demographics. The goal is to simulate real-world fraud analysis used in AML and fraud strategy roles at Canadian banks.

## Objectives
- Identify top fraud types by frequency and financial loss
- Detect regional hotspots with high fraud impact
- Analyze age range, gender, and solicitation method patterns
- Create visual summaries to support risk strategy and fraud intervention

## Tools & Libraries
- Python: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `geopandas`, `plotly`
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub for version control
